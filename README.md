# Borutska Brows

I developed a personal portfolio website for my client, who specializes in eyebrow and eyelash services. The project is a four-page multilingual website, which was completed in just over a week and a half. The website was built using Bootstrap 5.0 and the SASS preprocessor to ensure a flexible and scalable design. Additionally, I implemented a customization feature that allows the client to easily adjust font sizes, colors, and other visual elements according to her preferences.
